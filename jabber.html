`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
  And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/>
</p>

<p>
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br/>
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br/>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br/>
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br/>
</p>

<p>
He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br/>
  Long time the manxome foe he sought -- <br/>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br/>
  And stood awhile in thought.<br/>
</p>

<p>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br/>
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br/>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br/>
  And burbled as it came!<br/>
</p>

<p>
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br/>
He left it dead, and with its head<br/>
  He went galumphing back.<br/>
</p>

<p>
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br/>
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br/>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br/>
  He chortled in his joy.<br/>
</p>

<p>

`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
  And the mome raths outgrabe.
